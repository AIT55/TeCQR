# TeCQR

## This repository implements three core modules proposed in the paper:
- **Noise Tolerance Modeling** (`noise_tolerance.py`)
- **Tag-enhanced Conversational Retrieval** (`tag_enhanced_conversational_retrieval.py`)
- **Tag-enhanced Two-stage Offline Training** (`tag_enhanced_two_satge_offline_training.py`)
## Dataset Description
- **`question_tag.json`**: Contains the tags associated with each question.  
- **`question_text.txt`**: Stores the text content of questions.  
- **`tag_num.txt`**: Lists tags and their corresponding numeric IDs.  
- **`train.json`**: Training dataset.  
- **`test.json`**: Testing dataset.  
The dataset has been fully released, and all core modules are open-sourced. The complete data processing code will be provided soon.
